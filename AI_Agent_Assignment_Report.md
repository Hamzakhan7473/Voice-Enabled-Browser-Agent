## Assignment Overview

This assignment analyzes a **Voice-Enabled Browser Automation Agent** using the PEPAS framework and designs four different agent architectures for the same real-world task environment.

**Real Implementation:** Our system integrates speech recognition (Deepgram), browser automation (Browserbase/CDP), AI reasoning (OpenAI GPT-4o), and real-time feedback mechanisms.

## PEAS Specification

### Performance Metrics (Measurable Success Criteria)
- **Task Completion Rate:** ≥95% voice commands executed successfully
- **Response Time:** ≤3 seconds from command to action completion
- **Accuracy:** ≥90% correct interpretation of user intent
- **CAPTCHA Bypass:** ≥80% success in avoiding bot detection
- **Speech Recognition:** ≥95% accuracy in transcription

### Environment Classification
- **Partially Observable:** Limited browser view requires scrolling
- **Non-deterministic:** User speech varies, CAPTCHAs appear randomly
- **Sequential:** Navigation history affects future actions
- **Dynamic:** Websites change independently of agent actions
- **Continuous-Time:** Speech waveforms require real-time processing
- **Multi-agent:** User commands + anti-bot systems compete

### Actuators & Sensors

| **Actuators** | **Sensors** |
|---------------|-------------|
| Browser navigation (`page.goto()`) | Microphone audio input |
| Element clicking (`element.click()`) | Speech waveform analysis |
| Text input (`input.type()`) | Browser screenshots (1280x800) |
| Page scrolling (`page.scroll()`) | DOM element selectors |
| Screenshot capture (`page.screenshot()` | Page titles and URLs |
| JavaScript execution (`page.evaluate()`) | Loading status indicators |
| Voice feedback (`textToSpeech.speak()`) | CAPTCHA detection |
| Session management (`session.save()`) | Network latency metrics |

## Agent Design Comparison

### 1. Simple Reflex Agent

**Architecture:** Direct condition-action mappings without memory
```javascript
if (speech.includes("search")) → navigateToGoogle() + clickSearch()
if (speech.includes("login")) → clickLoginButton()
if (speech.includes("first result")) → clickFirstResult()
```

**Percept Attributes:** speech_text, page_elements, current_url, captcha_flag

**Failure Case:** User says "go back and click the second result" - agent lacks memory of previous results

### 2. Model-Based Reflex Agent

**Internal State Representation:**
```javascript
class ModelBasedAgent {
  state = {
    navigation_history: [],    // URL sequence record
    search_results: [],       // Last search results
    current_task: "",        // Active user goal
    page_load_status: "unknown", // Loading state
    session_data: {}         // Cross-page persistence
  }
}
```

**State Update Trace:**
```
Before: navigation_history=["google.com"]; search_results=[]
Percept: Search results page loaded
After: search_results=["Pizza Hut", "Domino's", "Local Pizza"]
Next: Click first result with context awareness
```

**Advantage:** Can handle "second result" commands using stored search history

### 3. Goal-Based Agent

**Goal Hierarchy:**
```
Primary: Execute user voice command accurately
├── Understand intent from speech
├── Navigate to target content
├── Complete requested action
└── Maintain user satisfaction
```

**Decision Process:** User says "find cheap pizza and book table"
1. Goal Decomposition: Search → → Filter by price → Locate nearby → Book table
2. Action Selection: Google Maps (better location + pricing data)
3. Progress Monitoring: Track each subgoal completion

### 4. Utility-Based Agent

**Utility Function:**
```
U(action) = 0.3×Speed + 0.3×Accuracy + 0.2×Satisfaction - 0.1×Risk - 0.1×Cost
```

**Trade-off Example:** "Buy product now"
- **Immediate Purchase:** Speed=0.9, Risk=0.8 → Utility = 0.59
- **Cart Review First:** Speed=0.6, Risk=0.2 → Utility = 0.69
- **Decision:** Choose cart review (higher utility despite slower speed)

## Computational Analysis

| Agent Type | Time Complexity | Memory Usage | Real-Time Suitability |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Simple Reflex | O(1) | Low | ✅ Excellent |
| Model-Based | O(n) | Medium | ✅ Good |
| Goal-Based | O(log n) | High | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Utility-Based | O(n²) | High | ❌ Limited |

**Error Patterns:**
- **Simple:** Context loss, pronoun confusion
- **Model-Based:** State inconsistency, memory overflow
- **Goal-Based:** Planning loops, resource exhaustion
- **Utility-Based:** Weight calibration errors

---

## Learning Agent Extension

**Enhanced Architecture:**
```javascript
class LearningAgent extends UtilityBasedAgent {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.experienceDatabase = new PatternMemory();
    this.adaptiveWeights = new WeightLearner();
    this.userPreferences = new PreferenceModel();
  }
  
  learnFromOutcome(action, result, feedback) {
    if (feedback > 0.7) {
      this.reinforcePattern(action.sequence);
      this.adaptiveWeights.increaseConfidence(action.strategy);
    } else {
      this.penalizePattern(action.sequence);
      this.adaptiveWeights.decreaseConfidence(action.strategy);
    }
  }
}
```

**Learning Benefits:**
- Personalized behavior adaptation
- Improved accuracy through experience
- Automatic error pattern avoidance
- User preference modeling

**Key Insights:**
- Simple reflex agents are efficient but limited by context
- Model-based agents provide necessary memory for complex tasks
- Goal-based agents excel at structured execution
- Utility-based agents optimize trade-offs but require computation
- Hybrid approaches leverage multiple strengths

**Practical Impact:**
Our analysis directly influenced the design of our production Voice Browser Agent, resulting in a robust system combining speech recognition, AI reasoning, browser automation, and user feedback mechanisms.

The progression from theoretical agent design to practical implementation reveals the importance of balancing architectural approaches based on real-world constraints and user requirements.
