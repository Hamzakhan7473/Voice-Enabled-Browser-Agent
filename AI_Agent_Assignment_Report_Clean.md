## 3. PEPAS Specification

### 3.1 Performance Metrics (Measurable Success Criteria)

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Task Completion Rate** | ≥95% | Successful voice commands / total commands |
| **Response Time** | ≤3 seconds | Time from command start to action completion |
| **Intent Accuracy** | ≥90% | Correct interpretations / total interpretations |
| **CAPTCHA Bypass Rate** | ≥80% | Successful actions avoiding detection |
| **Speech Recognition** <td colspan="2">≥95% | Deepgram transcript accuracy |
| **Session Persistence** | 100% | Maintains browser context across commands |

### 3.2 Environment Classification

| Property | Classification | Justification |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Observability** | Partially Observable | Agent must scroll/navigate to see full page content |
| **Determinism** | Non-deterministic | User speech varies, websites load inconsistently, CAPTCHAs appear randomly |
| **Episodic/Semi-Sequential** | Sequential | Actions build upon previous states; navigation history affects future actions |
| **Static/Dynamic** | Dynamic | Websites change independently of agent actions; content loads dynamically |
| **Discrete/Continuous** | Continuous | Speech waveforms are continuous signals requiring real-time processing |
| **Single/Multi-Agent** | Multi-agent | User provides commands while anti-bot systems act as competing agents |

### 3.3 Actuators (What the agent can do)

**Browser Control Actions:**
- Navigate to URLs (`page.goto()`)
- Click elements (`element.click()`)
- Type text (`input.type()`)
- Scroll pages (`page.scroll()`)
- Take screenshots (`page.screenshot()`)
- Extract content (`page.textContent()`)
- Execute JavaScript (`page.evaluate()`)

**Voice Processing Actions:**
- Start/stop audio capture (`audioCapture.startCapture()`)
- Process speech-to-text (`speechToText.transcribe()`)
- Parse user intents (`intentParser.parse()`)
- Generate voice feedback (`textToSpeech.speak()`)

**Session Management Actions:**
- Save session state (`session.save()`)
- Cache browser data (`cache.store()`)
- Archive screenshots (`archive.save()`)

### 3.4 Sensors (What the agent perceives)

**Audio Sensors:**
- Microphone input (continuous audio stream)
- Speech waveforms (frequency, amplitude, timing)
- Voice activity detection
- Audio quality metrics

**Visual Sensors:**
- Browser screenshots (1280x800 pixel images)
- DOM element selectors (CSS classes, IDs, XPaths)
- Page titles and URLs
- Text content and highlighted elements
- Loading states and error messages

**State Sensors:**
- Current browser page URL
- Page loading status indicators
- Form validation errors
- Search results count
- Session ID and authentication state
- CAPTCHA presence detection

**Environment Sensors:**
- Network latency indicators
- Browser responsiveness metrics
- Error logs and system diagnostics

## 4. Agent Design Comparison

### 4.1 Simple Reflex Agent

**Architecture:** Direct condition-action mappings without internal state

**Condition-Action Rules:**
```
IF speech contains "search for [X]" THEN navigate to google.com → click search box → type "[X]"
IF speech contains "go to [URL]" THEN navigate to "[URL]"
IF page shows "login" button THEN click "login" button
IF page shows search results THEN click first result link
IF speech contains "click [element]" THEN click element by text content
IF CAPTCHA detected THEN log warning and continue
IF speech contains "fill form" THEN find first form → type in first input field
```

**Percept Attributes Used:**
- `speech_text`: Raw transcript from speech-to-text
- `page_title`: Current browser page title
- `visible_text`: Text content of clickable elements
- `current_url`: Browser URL
- `captcha_present`: Boolean flag for CAPTCHA detection

**Failure Case:**
**Scenario:** User says "go back and click the second result"
**Why it fails:** Agent sees only current page state, lacks memory of previous search results
**Outcome:** Cannot identify "second result" without knowing what results were previously visible

**Limitation:** Cannot maintain context or handle sequential commands requiring historical knowledge

### 4.2 Model-Based Reflex Agent

**Internal State Representation:**
```
State = {
  navigation_history: [],      // Array of URLs visited
  search_results: [],          // Array of result titles/URLs
  current_task: "",           // String description of active task
  form_fields_filled: [],     // Array of completed form fields
  page_load_status: "unknown", // String: "loading", "loaded", "error"
  previous_screenshot: null   // Image object for visual reference
}
```

**State Update Trace:**
```
Before Percept:
navigation_history = ["google.com"]
current_task = "search for pizza"
search_results = []

New Percept:
Page loaded with search results for "pizza"

After Processing:
page_load_status = "loaded"
search_results = ["Pizza Hut", "Domino's", "Local Pizza"]

Next Action:
Click on "Pizza Hut" (first result) based on predetermined rule
```

**How This Avoids Simple Reflex Failure:**
- **Memory:** Maintains `search_results` array to reference "second result"
- **Context:** Uses `navigation_history` to understand "go back" means previous URL
- **Task Continuity:** `current_task` maintains user intent across multiple steps

**Example State Update Sequence:**
```
Step 1: User: "search for vegan restaurants"
       After: current_task = "search for vegan restaurants"
             navigation_history = ["google.com"]

Step 2: User: "go back and try again"  
       After: navigation_history = ["google.com"] (back to previous)
             current_task = "search for vegan restaurants" (maintained)
       Action: Navigate back with same search for "vegan restaurants"
```

### 4.3 Goal-Based Agent

**Goal Specification:**
```
Primary Goal: Execute user voice command with maximum accuracy

Subgoals:
├── Understand user intent from speech signals
├── Navigate efficiently to target content
├── Complete requested action successfully  
└── Maintain user satisfaction throughout process
```

**Decision-Making Process Example:**

**Scenario:** User says "find me a cheap pizza place nearby and book a table"

**Percept:** Speech text = "find me a cheap pizza place nearby and book a table"

**Goal Analysis:**
- Find restaurant (location data)
- Comparative analysis ("cheap" vs expensive)
- Geographic relevance ("nearby")
- Action execution ("book table")

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Goal Decomposition:** Break into sequential subgoals
   - Search → Filter by price → Select nearby → Attempt booking

2. **Resource Planning:** Choose Google Maps over general web search
   - Better locations + pricing data + reservation integration

3. **Action Selection:** Prioritize efficiency (distance + price) over speed

4. **Progress Monitoring:** Check subgoal completion before proceeding

**Goal Achievement Status:**
- Subgoal 1: ✅ Found restaurant listing
- Subgoal 2: ✅ Applied price filters  
- Subgoal 3: ✅ Selected from nearby options
- Subgoal 4: ❌ Booking interface found but reservation incomplete

**Adaptive Response:** 
"Found 3 cheap pizza places near you. The booking system requires manual form completion due to complex validation."

**Strengths:** Structured goal achievement, complex task handling
**Weaknesses:** May ignore risks to achieve goals, can get stuck in planning loops

### 4.4 Utility-Based Agent

**Mathematical Utility Function:**
```
U(action) = w₁×Speed + w₂×Accuracy + w₃×UserSatisfaction - w₄×Risk - w₅×Cost

Where:
- Speed = 1/time_to_complete_action (range: 0 to 1)
- Accuracy = percentage_of_successful_actions (range: 0 to 1) 
- UserSatisfaction = intent_matching_score (range: 0 to 1)
- Risk = probability_of_failure × severity (range: 0 to 1)
- Cost = computational_resources_used (range: 0 to 1)

Weight Assignment:
w₁ = 0.3 (Speed priority)
w₂ = 0.3 (Accuracy priority)  
w₃ = 0.2 (User Satisfaction)
w₄ = 0.1 (Risk avoidance)
w₅ = 0.1 (Cost efficiency)
```

**Trading Off Competing Objectives:**

**Scenario:** User says "buy this product now" on e-commerce site

**Option A - Immediate Purchase:**
- Speed = 0.9 (very fast execution)
- Accuracy = 0.8 (assumes correct product selection)
- UserSatisfaction = 0.6 (may be frustrating if wrong item)
- Risk = 0.8 (high - no confirmation or review)
- Cost = 0.2 (low computational overhead)

**Option B - Cart Review First:**
- Speed = 0.6 (slower due to extra steps)
- Accuracy = 0.95 (verified product details and quantity)
- UserSatisfaction = 0.9 (transparent process with confirmation)
- Risk = 0.2 (low - user explicitly confirms purchase)
- Cost = 0.4 (additional page interactions required)

**Utility Calculation:**
- Option A: U = 0.3×0.9 + 0.3×0.8 + 0.2×0.6 - 0.1×0.8 - 0.1×0.2 = **0.59**
- Option B: U = 0.3×0.6 + 0.3×0.95 + 0.2×0.9 - 0.1×0.2 - 0.1×0.4 = **0.69**

**Decision:** Choose Option B (show cart review) due to higher overall utility despite slower execution speed.

**Comparison with Goal-Based Agent:**
- **Goal-Based Decision:** Immediate execution toward "buy product" goal
- **Utility-Based Decision:** Weighted optimization considering safety over speed
- **Key Difference:** Utility agent avoids destructive actions through risk weighting, while goal-based agent prioritizes goal achievement over potential negative consequences.
