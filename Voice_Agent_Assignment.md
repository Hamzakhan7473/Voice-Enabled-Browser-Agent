# Voice-Enabled Browser Automation Agent: PEPAS Analysis

## Assignment Overview
This assignment analyzes a **Voice-Enabled Browser Automation Agent** using the PEPAS framework and designs four different agent architectures.

---

## 1. Task Environment Selection

**Domain:** Voice-Enabled Browser Automation Agent
**Description:** An AI agent that listens to natural language commands through speech recognition, interprets user intentions, and automates web browser actions across any website.

## 2. PEPAS Specification

### A. Performance (Success Metrics)

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Task Completion Rate:** ≥95% of voice commands successfully executed
- **Response Time:** ≤3 seconds from command to action completion
- **Accuracy:** ≥90% correct interpretation of user intent
- **CAPTCHA Bypass Rate:** ≥80% success in avoiding bot detection

**Measurable KPIs:**
- Speech-to-text accuracy: ≥95%
- Intent parsing precision: ≥90%
- Browser action success rate: ≥98%
- Session persistence: Maintain browser context across commands

### B. Environment

**Entities in the World:**
- Voice Agent (primary entity)
- Web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Websites (Google, social media, e-commerce, forms)
- Speech signals from user's microphone
- Browser DOM elements (buttons, links, forms, text)
- CAPTCHA challenges
- Network latency and connectivity

**Environment Dynamics:**
- Websites load and change dynamically
- User speech varies in clarity, accent, and vocabulary
- CAPTCHAs appear unpredictably
- Navigation creates new page states
- Forms have validation rules and error states

**Constraints:**
- Browser security policies (CORS, iframe restrictions)
- Rate limiting by websites
- Memory limitations for session data
- Real-time audio processing requirements

**Environment Properties Classification:**

1. **Partially Observable:** Agent cannot see all browser contents simultaneously
2. **Non-deterministic:** User speech varies, websites load inconsistently
3. **Sequential:** Actions build upon previous states; history matters
4. **Dynamic:** Websites change independently of agent actions
5. **Continuous:** Speech signal is continuous waveform
6. **Multi-agent:** User provides commands; anti-bot systems compete

### C. Actuators (What the agent can do)

**Browser Actions:**
- Navigate to URLs (page.goto())
- Click elements (element.click())
- Type text (input.type())
- Scroll pages (page.scroll())
- Take screenshots (page.screenshot())
- Extract page content (page.textContent())

**Voice Actions:**
- Start/stop listening (audioCapture.startCapture())
- Process speech (speechToText.transcribe())
- Parse intents (intentParser.parse())
- Respond with TTS (textToSpeech.speak())

### D. Sensors (What the agent perceives)

**Audio Sensors:**
- Microphone input (continuous audio stream)
- Speech waveforms (frequency, amplitude)
- Voice activity detection
- Audio quality metrics

**Visual Sensors:**
- Browser screenshots (1280x800 pixel images)
- DOM element selectors (CSS classes, IDs, XPaths)
- Page titles and URLs
- Text content and highlighted elements

**State Sensors:**
- Current browser page URL
- Page loading status
- Form validation errors
- Session ID and authentication state
- CAPTCHA presence detection
